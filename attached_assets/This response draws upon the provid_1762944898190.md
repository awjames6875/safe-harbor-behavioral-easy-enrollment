***

### Body & Brain™ Program Overview

#### What the program is

The Body & Brain Program provides **trauma-informed, evidence-based, and developmentally appropriate behavioral health services** to children ages 3–8 in a community setting, such as daycares. The program is structured, consistent, and uses a **Play + Therapy** approach, blending therapeutic techniques with movement, yoga, boxing, and creative games.

The curriculum utilizes a consistent and predictable daily schedule designed to provide therapeutic structure. The program aims to meet medical necessity standards for SoonerCare and private insurance billing.

#### Benefits to children (development, learning, growth)

The program offers holistic development by promoting:

*   **Emotional Regulation:** Children learn self-soothing skills and ways to manage frustration.
*   **Social Skills:** Skills are reinforced through peer interaction, sharing, and conflict resolution.
*   **Resilience and Confidence:** The program helps children shape their inner voice to be confident ("I can handle this challenge"), resilient ("Setbacks help me grow stronger"), and hopeful.
*   **Skill Building:** Supports children in **recognizing and expressing emotions in healthy ways**.
*   **Impulse Control:** Reinforces regulation and impulse control.

#### What kids will learn and experience

Children experience a structured, 4-hour daily flow that integrates skills training, movement, and reflection. Activities are examples of "Disguised Learning," meaning kids think it is fun, but they are developing critical coping skills.

Activities are aligned with weekly themes like "Big Feelings, Small Steps," "My Safe Body," and "Friends Make It Better". Examples of activities include:

*   **Skills Training (H2014-HA):** Structured social-emotional learning (SEL), story-based lessons, and games like **Emotion Charades + Freeze Dance**.
*   **Regulation/Movement (H2021-HA):** Practice coping strategies such as **Stop & Go Yoga** and **Personal Space Bubble Walk**. Children are encouraged to move frequently, as young children need movement every 20 minutes.
*   **Check-Ins (H2015-HA):** Daily emotional check-ins using a Feelings Chart or color zones.

#### Why parents should enroll their children

The program is a solution addressing the widespread issue of **childhood trauma** (80% of children experience some form) and the **limited access to support** (only 21% of children receive the mental health services they need).

By enrolling their children, parents ensure their child receives:

*   **Licensed Care On-Site:** Services are brought directly to the daycare by licensed clinicians, **eliminating transportation barriers**.
*   **Trauma-Informed Support:** The program provides the tools children need to process stress and prevent unspoken pain from turning into anger or violence.
*   **Holistic Development:** The curriculum builds confidence, friendships, emotional regulation, and school readiness.
*   **Addressing Stigma:** The program helps break down stigma, particularly in Black and Brown communities, that often creates barriers to care.
