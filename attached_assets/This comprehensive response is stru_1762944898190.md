## SafeHarbor Body & Brain Program: Chatbot Content Guide

### I. Documents I Need From You

#### Mission Statement - Your Safe Harbor mission statement document
The provided sources do not contain a formal document explicitly labeled "Safe Harbor mission statement." However, the core purpose and foundational philosophy of the organization, which should guide your AI's responses, are clearly defined:

The program's underlying philosophy is to **break the cycle of stigma** surrounding mental health by bringing support directly to where children already are: inside trusted daycares.

The goal is to provide **trauma-informed, evidence-based behavioral health curriculum** to young children aged 3–8, focusing on emotion regulation, communication, social skills, and brain-based behavior supports.

By delivering services through **"disguised learning"**—where kids think they are just playing through boxing, yoga, games, and music—the stigma is erased because the services look and feel like everyday childcare. SafeHarbor is dedicated to supporting a child's **"journey of healing, learning, and growth"**.
