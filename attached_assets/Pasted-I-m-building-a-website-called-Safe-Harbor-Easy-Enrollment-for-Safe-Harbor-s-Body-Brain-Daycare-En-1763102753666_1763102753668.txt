I'm building a website called Safe Harbor Easy Enrollment for Safe Harbor's Body & Brain™ Daycare Enrollment program at safeharboreasyenrollment.com.

Please do the following in this Replit project:

1. Create a new responsive HTML page called `terms-of-service.html` (or a /terms route, depending on this stack) that:
   - Uses simple, clean styling (system fonts, good spacing, mobile-friendly).
   - Includes a top navigation link or button to go "Back to Enrollment" (link to `/`).
   - Shows the heading "Terms of Service" and the "Last updated" date.
   - Uses the exact Terms of Service text below, preserving all section headings:
