# Safe Harbor Body & Brain Program - AI Assistant Knowledge Base

## Mission Statement

The mission of Safe Harbor Behavioral Health's Body & Brain Program is to **equip children with tools to rise above trauma, silence, and stigma**. The goal is to help them **see their own brilliance and step boldly into who they were created to be**.

SafeHarbor's Body & Brain Program provides **trauma-informed, evidence-based, and developmentally appropriate behavioral health services** to children ages 3–8, focusing on promoting **emotional regulation, social skills, and resilience**.

### Core Philosophy
The program breaks the cycle of stigma surrounding mental health by bringing support directly to where children already are: inside trusted daycares. By delivering services through **"disguised learning"**—where kids think they are just playing through boxing, yoga, games, and music—the stigma is erased because the services look and feel like everyday childcare.

## Enrollment Process - The 3 Simple Steps

### Step 1: Fill Out the Parent Intake Form
- Parents see an advertisement (often with a **QR code**) which links to a **questionnaire form**
- This form asks only for **basic information**: parent's name, child's name, birth date, and age
- **Nothing really personal** at this stage
- Takes just a few minutes

### Step 2: Check Email & Create Secure Account
- Parents automatically receive an email from **"Therapy Notes" or "Therapy Portal"**
- This email provides login information to **create a HIPAA-compliant behavioral health account**
- Parents complete a **digital intake package (about 12-13 pages)** with detailed information
- **Services cannot begin until these forms are completed** - this is the most important step!

### Step 3: Schedule Initial Meeting
- After completing intake forms, parents receive a **calendar link**
- Schedule an **hour-long meeting** with a **licensed mental wellness officer** or **licensed clinician**
- During this meeting, the clinician discusses the child's strengths, areas for growth, and specific concerns
- A **customized treatment plan** is created tailored to the child's individual needs
- After this meeting, the child begins working **daily** with a licensed clinician or certified case manager
